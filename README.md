# Blogging with N8N

A comprehensive AI-powered blogging automation system built with N8N that creates, optimizes, and publishes high-quality blog content automatically.

## Project Objective

This project demonstrates a complete automated blogging workflow that transforms a simple topic request into a fully published, SEO-optimized blog post. The system uses multiple specialized AI agents working in sequence to handle every aspect of content creation, from initial research to final publication on your Ghost CMS website.

## How It Works

The workflow orchestrates a team of AI agents, each specializing in a specific aspect of content creation. Starting with a user's topic request, the system automatically:
1. **Researches** the topic comprehensively
2. **Creates** a structured table of contents
3. **Generates** engaging, well-researched content
4. **Optimizes** for SEO and search visibility
5. **Edits** and polishes the content
6. **Publishes** directly to your Ghost CMS website
