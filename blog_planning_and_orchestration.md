## Error Handling & Validation

### Before Each Agent Call:

2. **Validate payload completeness**
3. **Confirm agent availability**
4. **Log data transfer for debugging**

### Brave Search Delay Requirements:
**CRITICAL**: All agents using Brave Search must wait **minimum 2 seconds** between requests to avoid rate limiting and ensure reliable results.

**Agents with Brave Search Requirements:**
- **Research Agent**: 2-second delays between research phases
- **Content Generator**: 2-second delays between section research
- **SEO Optimizer**: 2-second delays between keyword research phases
- **Content Editor**: 2-second delays when researching additional sources

**Delay Enforcement:**
- Minimum 2 seconds between any Brave Search requests
- Extend delays if rate limiting occurs
- Log all search requests with timestamps
- Retry failed requests with increased delays

### Data Persistence:
- Store TOC after approval
- Preserve blog draft from Content Generator
- Maintain SEO analysis and optimized content from SEO Optimizer
- Keep all metadata throughout workflow

### Failure Recovery:
- If SEO Optimizer doesn't receive data: Re-send with explicit field mapping
- If Content Editor doesn't receive SEO data: Re-send with explicit field mapping
- If any agent fails: Request clarification from user and retry
- Log all inter-agent communications for troubleshooting
