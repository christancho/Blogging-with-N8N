- **SEO Optimizer Agent**: 2-second delays between keyword research phases
- **Blog Content Editor Agent**: 2-second delays when researching additional sources

**Delay Enforcement:**
- Minimum 2 seconds between any Brave Search requests
- Extend delays if rate limiting occurs
- Log all search requests with timestamps
- Retry failed requests with increased delays

### Data Persistence:

- Preserve blog draft from Content Generator
- Maintain SEO analysis and optimized content from SEO Optimizer
- Keep all metadata throughout workflow

### Failure Recovery:
- If SEO Optimizer Agent doesn't receive data: Re-send with explicit field mapping
- If Blog Content Editor Agent doesn't receive SEO data: Re-send with explicit field mapping
- If any agent fails: Request clarification from user and retry
- Log all inter-agent communications for troubleshooting
